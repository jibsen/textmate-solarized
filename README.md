The goal is to get as-close-as-possible to the rendering of the same file in Vim. 
If you would like to help, here's how to get involved:

1. Fork this repo and checkout your own copy.
2. Download the [sample documents](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/utils/tests). 
3. Make your changes to files under `src/`
   - Please change only one language per commit.
   - Please specify colors using the `$color` convention seen throughout the files.
     (This ensures color consistency with the official Solarized colors, as well as 
     color consistency between different languages.)
