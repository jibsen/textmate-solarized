# `src/`


## How this directory is organized 

Files in this directory each contain a piece of the Solarized code.  
Each file is named for a specific language, and contains the instructions 
for syntax highlights according to Solarized.  

The only exceptions to this naming scheme is the `theme.yaml` file, which
contains the top level keys and language independent root groups, and the
`dict_dark.yaml` and `dict_light.yaml` files, which contain dictionaries
for the placeholders used.

The build process automatically generates both the “dark” and “light” flavors
of the Solarized theme from this single set of files.  The files in this
directory contain the colors for the “dark” flavor.  The “light” Solarized theme
is generated by the `yamltotm.py` script, which flips the 4 base pairs of colors.


### Structure matters

The source files are all [YAML](http://yaml.org/), organized so the first file,
`theme.yaml`, starts the `settings` array, and the elements in all other files
go into it.

Because of this, it is important to use the same layout and indentation as seen
in the files here.


## Use `$color`s

In this directory, all color values are specified using the form `$color`,
where `color` is one of the color names as seen on
[the official Solarized color table](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#the-values).

During the build process, these placeholders are replaced with their hex color values
using the dictionaries.
